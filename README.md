Five high-risk buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been identified in the SCU of China Grid Power. These vulnerabilities pose severe threats: they could cause system crashes, disrupting power dispatch and monitoring operations. Worse, malicious actors might exploit them to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access, tamper with critical power system data, or even sabotage power supply infrastructure, endangering the stability and security of the entire power grid.
